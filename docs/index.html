      My name is Parker Lindsey and I am an aspiring web developer, welcome to my portfolio page! I have been learning about web development for about 6 months now and am ready to take the next big step. I want to make this my career and am ready and willing to learn whatever it takes to be the best I can be.

    <h1 class="about__title">About Me</h1>
    <p class="about__paragraph">
      I have been interested in technology since I was a kid. It started out with playing games on our old CRT monitor computer and eventually led to some IT classes in high school. I learned the physical components well enough but that wasn't all that I wanted to learn, so I went to college for a semester and took a couple of intro courses in computer science. They were good for the basics but I needed something else, college just wasnt doing it for me. So after leaving I realized I had to teach myself, and that's what I've been doing for the past two years.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I have tried quite a few different online courses on a variety of websites (Udemy, Skillshare, Coursera, Codingphase) and am using everything that I have been learning and making it into something of my own. I am super excited to finally be doing something that I can call 100% my own and show it off. It feels like my journey has already lasted forever, though I know I am only getting started.
